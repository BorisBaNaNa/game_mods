Where come from all paths?

All paths is composed by his folders category,
and all is listed in:
Krastorio2\lib\public\data-stages\paths.lua

For example, kr_entities_icons_path is equal to:

kr_entities_icons_path = kr_icons_path  + "entities/"
and
kr_icons_path = kr_graphic_mod + "icons/"
and
kr_graphic_mod = "__Krastorio2-graphics__/graphics/"
so the final result is:
"__Krastorio2-graphics__/graphics/icons/entities/"

In all Krastorio 2 things the general prefix is kr

All paths is meant for be used only in data stages
